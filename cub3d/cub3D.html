        <p class="writer-message">This is a demonstration of my raycasting engine written in C. Digital differential alasysis (DDA) is used to calculate the distance to walls and sprites.
        The map is a grid of 0's and 1's loaded in from a file, a 0 being an empty space and a 1 being a wall. The walls and sprites are loaded in by the user with each face(north,south etc) being from a different png file.
        I had to use a primitive library provided by Codam called miniLibx(https://github.com/42paris/minilibx-linux) in order to render the graphics (to make it a bit harder I guess). However, to create this demo I had to compile all my files with emscripten into a WASM file 
        and emscripten didn't support minilibX so I had to convert everything to the SDL library which turned out to be the better option anyway. <br> <br>
        These were the only allowed functions:<br>
        • open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit, gettimeofday.<br>
        • All functions of the math library<br>
        • All functions of the MinilibX library.<br>
